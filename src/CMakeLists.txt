# This file is a placeholder - all subdirectories are now added from root CMakeLists.txt
# Root CMakeLists.txt handles:
# - Clang compiler detection and configuration
# - vcpkg integration
# - Qt6 setup with cross-platform paths
# - C++ standard and build options
# - Adding all backend, frontend, and test subdirectories

# All modules are added from the root CMakeLists.txt to avoid out-of-tree source issues
